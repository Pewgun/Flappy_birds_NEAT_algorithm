# Flappy_birds_NEAT_algorithm
This is an implementation of the NEAT algorithm on the game of Flappy birds.
The algortihm was used to teach agents(birds) how to play the game.

The algoithm was succesful in achieving its goal i.e. was able to teach the agants how to play Flappy birds.

To see how the game works run flappyBirds.py.
